Repository for GenTest, a Northern Arizona University capstone team.

## Northern Arizona University Capstone
This project is being developed by team GenTest. The Team members and roles are as follows:
* Team Lead/Editor - Joshua Johnson
* Recorder - Silu Shen
* Architect - Tristan Miller
* Coder - Zane Fink

All team members are also "coders" and are expected to develop GenTest


## Purpose:
The purpose of GenTest is to utilize [DeepState](https://github.com/trailofbits/deepstate)
 and create a standalone test. This standalone test will allow for the reuse of generated values
 as well as running tests generated by DeepState without requiring DeepState itself.
 
## Build Instructions
This will need to be updated as development continues
