## Automatic Standalone Unit Test Generation for DeepState

[DeepState](https://github.com/trailofbits/deepstate) is a software platform that enables
    comprehensive testing of a codebase with very little work from the programmer. GenTest
    seeks to bring DeepState into the mainstream by designing software to improve integrations
    with mainstream testing platforms such as GoogleTest. For more about our project and proposed solution,
