# The Problem   


Programmers write code. Sometimes, programmers even test the code they write. Typically, a programmer will
write unit tests that test the individual components of software to ensure they perform as
intented. Unit testing suffers from a fundamental flaw: developers only write tests for the bugs they
expect to find. The solution: DeepState.


DeepState is a software platform developed by Trail of Bits and NAU's Dr. Alex Groce
that allows programmers to write generic tests. These generic tests are then used to 
create many thousands of concrete tests, enabling the testing of many more conditions than if a programmer
were to write the tests themselves. In its current form, DeepState is difficult to install and use,
and generated tests remain in DeepState's binary format, limiting test replayability.
Enter GenTest.

# The Solution
Team GenTest seeks to alleviate some of the issues currently present in DeepState by creating
a command-line tool that exports the tests generated by DeepState into the format of common testing frameworks
such as Google Test. This will allow programmers to test software they are
developing or importing into a project without ever having to install DeepState.    
Not only will this tool increase the usability of DeepState outside of academia, but it will also
enable the development of more robust software.
