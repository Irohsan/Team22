# The Problem   


Programmers write code. Sometimes, programmers even test the code they write. Typically, a programmer will
write unit tests that test the individual components of software to ensure they perform as
intented. Unit testing suffers from a fundamental flaw: programmers only write tests for the bugs they
expect to find.
